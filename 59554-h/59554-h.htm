<p class="caption2"><a id="INTRODUCTION" name="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</p>


<p>There are several species of flies which are commonly found in
houses, although but one of these should be called the house fly proper.
This is the <i>Musca domestica</i> L. (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) and is a medium-sized, grayish
fly, with its mouth parts spread out at the tip for sucking up liquid
substances. It is found in nearly all parts of the world. On account
of the conformation of its mouth parts, the house fly can not bite,
yet no impression is stronger in the minds of most people than that
this insect does occasionally bite. This impression is due to the
frequent occurrence in houses of another fly (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i> L.)
(<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>), which is called the stable fly, and which, while closely resembling
the house fly (so closely, in fact, as to deceive anyone but an
entomologist), differs from it in the important particular that its
mouth parts are formed for piercing the skin. It is perhaps second in
point of abundance to the house fly in most portions of the Northeastern
States. It breeds in horse manure, cow manure, and in warm
decaying vegetation like old straw and grass heaps.</p>

enlarged parts at right. All enlarged. (Author&rsquo;s Illustration.)</span>
</div>

<p>A third species, commonly called the cluster fly (<i>Pollenia rudis</i>
Fab.), is a very frequent visitant of houses, particularly in the spring
and fall. This fly is somewhat larger than the house fly, with a dark-colored,
smooth abdomen and a sprinkling of yellowish hairs. It is
not so active as the house fly and, particularly in the fall, is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
sluggish. At such times it may be picked up readily and is very
subject to the attacks of a fungous disease which causes it to die upon
window panes, surrounded by a whitish efflorescence. Occasionally
this fly occurs in houses in such numbers as to cause great annoyance,
but such occurrences are comparatively rare. It is said in its earlier
stages to be parasitic on certain angleworms.</p>

<p>A fourth species is another stable fly, known as <i>Muscina stabulans</i>
Fall. (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), a form which almost exactly resembles the house fly in
general appearance, and which does not bite as does the biting stable
fly. It breeds in decaying vegetable matter and in excrement.</p>

</div>

<p>Several species of metallic greenish or bluish flies are also occasionally
found in houses, the most abundant of which is the so-called blue-bottle
fly (<i>Calliphora erythrocephala</i> Meig.). This insect is also called
the blow-fly or meat-fly and breeds in decaying animal material. A
smaller species, which may be called the small blue-bottle fly, is
<i>Phormia terrænovæ</i> Desv. (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>); and a third, which is green or
blue in color and a trifle smaller than the large blue-bottle, is <i>Lucilia
cæsar</i> L. (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>There is still another species, smaller than any of those so far mentioned,
which is known to entomologists as <i>Homalomyia canicularis</i>
L., sometimes called the small house fly. A related species, <i>H. brevis</i>
Rond., is shown in <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>. <i>H. canicularis</i> is distinguished from the
ordinary house fly by its paler and more pointed body and conical
shape. The male, which is much commoner than 'the female, has
large pale patches at the base of the abdomen, which are translucent
when the fly is seen on a window pane. It is this species that is
largely responsible for the prevalent idea that flies grow after gaining
wings. Most people think that these little Homalomyias are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
young of the larger flies, which, of course, is distinctly not the case.
They breed in decaying vegetable material, in the excreta of animals,
and in dead insects.</p>

<p>Still another fly, and this one is still smaller, is a jet-black species
known as the window fly (<i>Scenopinus fenestralis</i> L.), which in fact has
become more abundant of later years. Its larva is a white, very
slender, almost thread-like creature, and is found in cracks of the
floor in buildings, where it feeds on other small insects.</p>

<p>In the autumn, when fruit appears on the sideboard, many specimens
of a small fruit-fly (<i>Drosophila ampelophila</i> Loew) (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) make
their appearance, attracted by the odor of overripe fruit.</p>

<p>A small, slender fly is not infrequently seen in houses, especially
upon window panes. This is <i>Sepsis violacea</i> Meig., shown enlarged
in <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>All of these species, however, are greatly dwarfed in numbers by
the common house fly. In 1900 the writer made collections of the
flies in dining rooms in different parts of the country, and out of a
total of 23,087 flies 22,808 were <i>Musca domestica</i>&mdash;that is, 98.8 per
cent of the whole number captured. The remainder, consisting of
1.2 per cent of the whole, comprised various species, including those
mentioned above.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="LIFE_HISTORY" name="LIFE_HISTORY"></a>LIFE HISTORY OF THE TRUE HOUSE FLY.</p>

<p><i>Musca domestica</i> commonly lays its eggs upon horse manure.
This substance seems to be its favorite larval food. It will oviposit
on cow manure, but we have not been able to rear it in this substance.
It will also breed in human excrement, and from this habit it becomes
very dangerous to the health of human beings, carrying, as it does,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
the germs of intestinal diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera
from excreta to food supplies. It will also lay its eggs upon other
decaying vegetable and animal material, but of the flies that infest
dwelling houses, both in cities and on farms, a vast proportion comes
from horse manure.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 225px;">

<span class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;One of the blue-bottle flies (<i>Phormia
terrænovæ</i>): Adult, enlarged. (Author&rsquo;s Illustration.)</span>
</div>

<p>It often happens, however, that this fly is very abundant in localities
where there is little or no horse
manure, and in such cases it will be
found breeding in other manure or
in slops or fermenting vegetable
material, such as spent hops, or
bran, or ensilage.</p>

<p>At Salem, Mass., Packard states
that he reared a generation in 14
days in horse manure. The duration
of the egg state was 24 hours,
the larval state from 5 to 7 days,
and the pupal state from 5 to 7
days. At Washington the writer
has found in midsummer that each
female lays at one time about 120
eggs, which hatch in 8 hours, the
larval period lasting 5 days and the
pupal 5 days, making the total time for the development of the generation
10 days. This was at the end of June. The periods of
development vary with the climate and with the season, and the insect
hibernates in the puparium condition in manure or at the surface of
the ground under a manure heap.
It also hibernates in houses as adult,
hiding in crevices.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 225px;">
<a id="fig5" name="fig5"></a>
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="225" height="229" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;The green-bottle fly (<i>Lucilia cæsar</i>):
Adult, enlarged. (Author&rsquo;s Illustration.)</span>
</div>

<p>The Washington observations indicate
that the larvæ molt twice, and
that there are thus three distinct
larval stages.</p>

<p>The periods of development were
found to be about as follows: Egg
from deposition to hatching, one-third
of a day; hatching of larva to
first molt, 1 day; first to second
molt, 1 day; second molt to pupation,
3 days; pupation to issuing of
adult, 5 days; total life round, approximately
10 days. There is thus abundance of time for the
development of 12 or 13 generations in the climate of Washington
every summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span></p>

<p>The number of eggs laid by an individual fly at one time is undoubtedly
large, averaging about 120, and a single female may lay 4
such batches, so that the enormous numbers in which the insects
occur is thus plainly accounted for, especially when the abundance
and universal occurrence of appropriate larval food is considered.
In order to ascertain the numbers in which house-fly larvæ occur in
horse-manure piles, a quarter of a pound of rather well-infested horse
manure was taken on August 9, and in it were counted 160 larvæ and
146 puparia. This would make about 1,200 house flies to the pound
of manure. This, however, can not be taken as an average, since no
larvæ are found in perhaps the greater part of ordinary horse-manure
piles. Neither, however, does it show the limit of what can be found,
since about 200 puparia were found in less than 1 cubic inch of
manure taken from a spot 2 inches below the surface of the pile where
the larvæ had congregated in immense numbers. The different stages
of the insect are well illustrated in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> and need no description.</p>

</div>


<p class="caption2"><a id="CARRIAGE_OF_DISEASE" name="CARRIAGE_OF_DISEASE"></a>CARRIAGE OF DISEASE.</p>

<p>In army camps, in mining camps, and in great public works, bringing
together large numbers of men for a longer or shorter time, there
is seldom the proper care of excreta, and the carriage of typhoid
germs from the latrines and privies to food by flies is common and
often results in epidemics of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>And such carriage of typhoid by flies is by no means confined to
these great temporary camps. In farmhouses in small communities
and even in the badly cared-for portions of large cities typhoid
germs are carried from excrement to food by flies, and the proper
supervision and treatment of the breeding places of the house fly
become most important elements in the prevention of typhoid.</p>

<p>In the same way other intestinal germ diseases are carried by flies.
The Asiatic cholera, dysentery, and infantile diarrhea are all so carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>

<p>Nor are the disease-bearing possibilities of the house fly limited to
intestinal germ diseases. There is strong circumstantial evidence
that tuberculosis, anthrax, yaws, ophthalmia, smallpox, tropical
sore, and parasitic worms may be and are so carried. Actual laboratory
proof exists in the cases of a number of these diseases, and
where lacking is replaced by circumstantial evidence amounting
almost to certainty.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="REMEDIES_AND_PREVENTIVES" name="REMEDIES_AND_PREVENTIVES"></a>REMEDIES AND PREVENTIVES.</p>

<p>A careful screening of windows and doors during the summer
months, with the supplementary use of sticky fly papers, is a preventive
measure against house flies known to everyone, and there
seems to be little hope in the near future of much relief by doing away
with the breeding places. A single stable in which a horse is kept
will supply house flies for an extended neighborhood. People living
in agricultural communities will probably never be rid of the pest,
but in cities, with better methods of disposal of garbage and with the
lessening of the number of horses and horse stables consequent upon
electric street railways, bicycles, and automobiles, the time may come,
and before very long, when window screens may be discarded. The
prompt gathering of horse manure, which may be variously treated
or kept in a specially prepared receptacle, would greatly abate the
fly nuisance, and city ordinances compelling horse owners to follow
some such course are desirable. Absolute cleanliness, even under
existing circumstances, will always result in a diminution of the numbers
of the house fly, and, in fact, most household insects are less
attracted to the premises of what is known as the old-fashioned house-keeper
than to those of the other kind.</p>

<p>Not only must all horse stables be cared for, but chicken yards, piggeries,
and garbage receptacles as well, and absolutely sanitary privies
are prime necessities. Directions for building and caring for such
privies will be found in Farmers' Bulletin No. 463. The dry-earth
treatment of privy vaults is unsatisfactory. Kerosene should be
used.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1897 a series of experiments was carried out
with the intention of showing whether it would be possible to treat a
manure pile in such a way as to stop the breeding of flies. The writer&rsquo;s
experience with the use of air-slaked lime on cow manure to prevent
the breeding of the horn fly (<i>Hæmatobia serrata</i> Rob.-Desv.) suggested
experimentation with different lime compounds. It was found to be
perfectly impracticable to use air-slaked lime, land plaster, or gas
lime with good results. Few or no larvæ were killed by a thorough
mixing of the manure with any of these three substances. Chlorid
of lime, however, was found to be an excellent maggot killer. Where
1 pound of chlorid of lime was mixed with 8 quarts of horse manure,
90 per cent of the maggots were killed in less than 24 hours. At the
rate of one-fourth of a pound of chlorid of lime to 8 quarts of manure,
however, the substance was found not to be sufficiently strong.
Chlorid of lime, though cheap in Europe, costs at least 3½ cents a
pound in large quantities in this country, so that the frequent treatment
of a large manure pile with this substance would be out of the
question in actual practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span></p>

<p>Experiments were therefore carried on with kerosene. It was
found that 8 quarts of fresh horse manure sprayed with 1 pint of
kerosene, which was afterwards washed down with 1 quart of water,
was thoroughly rid of Irving maggots. Every individual was killed
by the treatment. This experiment and others of a similar nature on
a small scale were so satisfactory that it was considered at the close of
the season that a practical conclusion had been reached, and that it
was perfectly possible to treat any manure pile economically and in
such a way as to prevent the breeding of flies.</p>

<p>Practical work in the summer of 1898, however, demonstrated that
this was simply another case where an experiment on a small scale
has failed to develop points which in practical work would vitiate the
results.</p>

<p>The stable of the United States Department of Agriculture, in
which about 12 horses were kept, was situated about 100 yards
behind the main building of the department and about 90 yards from
the building in which the Bureau of Entomology is situated. This
stable was always very carefully kept. The manure was thoroughly
swept up every morning, carried outside of the stable, and
deposited in a pile behind the building. This pile, after accumulating
for a week or 10 days, or sometimes 2 weeks, was carried off by the
gardeners and spread upon distant portions of the grounds. At all
times in the summer this manure pile swarmed with the maggots of
the house fly. It is safe to say that on an average many thousands of
perfect flies issued from it every day, and that at least a large share of
the flies which constantly bothered the employees in the two buildings
mentioned came from this source.</p>

<p>On the basis of the experiments of 1897, an attempt was made,
beginning early in April, 1898, to prevent the breeding of house flies
about the department by the treatment of this manure pile with kerosene.
The attempt was begun early in April and was carried on for
some weeks. While undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of flies were
destroyed in the course of this work, it was found by the end of May
that it was far from perfect, since if used at an economical rate the
kerosene could not be made to penetrate throughout the whole pile of
manure, even when copiously washed down with water. A considerable
proportion of house-fly larvæ escaped injury from this treatment,
which at the same time was found, even at an economical cost, to be
laborious, and such a measure, in fact, as almost no one could be
induced to adopt.</p>

<p>There remained, however, another measure which had been suggested
by the writer in an article on the house fly published in 1895,
namely, the preparation of an especial receptacle for the manure; and
this was very readily accomplished. A closet 6 by 8 feet had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
built in the corner of the stable nearest the manure pile. It had a door
opening into the stable proper, and also a window. A door was built
in the outside wall of this closet, and the stablemen were directed to
place no more manure outside the building; in other words, to abolish
the outside manure pile, and in the future to throw all of the manure
collected each morning into this closet, the window of which in the
meantime had been furnished with a wire screen. The preparations
were completed by the middle of June, and a barrel of chlorid of lime
was put in the corner of the closet. Since that time every morning the
manure of the stable is thrown into the closet, and a small shovelful of
chlorid of lime is scattered over it. At the expiration of 10 days or 2
weeks the gardeners open the outside door, shovel the manure into a
cart, and carry if off to be thrown upon the grounds.</p>

<p>Judging from actual examination of the manure pile, the measure is
eminently successful. Very few flies are breeding in the product of
the stable which formerly gave birth to many thousands daily. After
this measure had been carried on for two weeks, employees of the
department who had no knowledge of the work that was going on
were asked whether they had noticed any diminution in the number
of flies in their offices. Persons in all of the offices on the first floor of
the two buildings were asked this question. In every office except
one the answer was that a marked decrease had been noticed, so that
the work must be considered to have been successful.</p>

<p>The account of this remedial work has been given with some detail,
since it shows so plainly that care and cleanliness combined with such
an arrangement as that described will in an individual stable measurably
affect the fly nuisance in neighboring buildings.</p>

<p>With the combined efforts of the persons owning stables in a given
community, much more effective results can undoubtedly be gained.</p>

<p>In the consideration of these measures we have not touched upon the
remedies for house flies breeding in human excrement. On account
of the danger of the carriage of typhoid fever, the dropping of human
excrement in the open in cities or towns, either on vacant lots or in
dark alleyways, should be made a misdemeanor, and the same care
should be taken by the sanitary authorities to remove or cover up
such depositions as is taken in the removal of the bodies of dead animals.
The box privy is always a nuisance from many points of view,
and is undoubtedly dangerous as a breeder of flies which may carry
the germs of intestinal disease. No box privies should be permitted
to exist unless they are conducted on the kerosene principle. With
a proper vault or other receptacle, closed except from above, and a
free use of kerosene and water, the breeding of house flies can be prevented.</p>

<p>A Parisian journal, the Matin, during the winter of 1905-6, established
a prize of 10,000 francs for the best essay on the destruction of
the house fly. The jury of competent scientific men awarded the
prize to the author of a memoir in which it was proposed to use residuum
oil in the destruction of the
eggs and larvæ of the fly. This oil is
to be used in privies and cesspools.
Two liters per superficial meter of
the pit is mixed with water, stirred
with a stick of wood, and then
thrown into the receptacle. It is
said to form a covering of oil which
kills all the larvæ, preventing the
entrance of flies into the pit and, at
the same time, the hatching of eggs.
It makes a protective covering for
the excrement, and this is said to
hasten the development of anærobic
bacteria as in a true septic pit,
leading in this way to the rapid
liquefaction of solid matters and
rendering them much more unfit
for the development of other bacteria.
For manure it is recommended
to mix this residuum oil
with earth, with lime, and with
phosphates, and to spread it at different
times, in the spring by preference,
upon the manure of farms
and stables and so on.</p>

<p>There seems to be a definite period
of perhaps 10 days between the
issuing of the adult flies and the
laying of eggs. During this period,
and especially in the early spring,
it becomes important to trap as
many flies as possible. With this
end in view, Prof. C. F Hodge, of
Clark University, Worcester, Mass.,
has devised certain flytraps which
he attaches to garbage cans and to
screened stable windows, and which he places in the neighborhood of
possible fly-breeding places.</p>

<p>So many cheap flytraps are on the market that it is unnecessary and
undesirable to specify any particular kind. Many of them are good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="NATURAL_ENEMIES" name="NATURAL_ENEMIES"></a>NATURAL ENEMIES.</p>

<p>The house fly has a number of natural enemies. The common
house centipede (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>) destroys it in considerable numbers, there is a
small reddish mite which frequently covers its body and gradually
destroys it, it is subject to the attacks of hymenopterous parasites in
its larval condition, and it is destroyed by predatory beetles at the
same time.</p>

<p>The most effective enemy, however, is a fungous disease known as
<i>Empusa muscæ</i>, which carries off flies in large numbers, particularly
toward the close of the season. The epidemic ceases in December,
and although many thousands are killed by it, the remarkable rapidity
of development in the early summer months soon more than replaces
the thousands thus destroyed.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="WHAT_CITIES_AND_TOWNS_CAN_DO" name="WHAT_CITIES_AND_TOWNS_CAN_DO"></a>WHAT CITIES AND TOWNS CAN DO.</p>

<p>It would appear, from what we know of the life history of the common
house fly and from what remedial experimentation has already
been carried on, that it is perfectly feasible for cities and towns to
reduce the numbers of these annoying and dangerous insects so
greatly as to render them of comparatively slight account. The
health departments of most of our cities have the authority to abate
nuisances dangerous to health, and it is easy for the health authorities
of any city to formulate rules concerning the construction and care of
stables and the keeping and disposal of manure which, if enforced,
will do away with the house-fly nuisance. Such a series of rules was
formulated in the spring of 1906 by the Health Department of the
city of Asheville, N. C, and an effort is being made during this summer
to see that they are enforced. On the 3d of May, 1906, the Health
Department of the District of Columbia also issued a series of orders
of this nature, on the authority of the Commissioners of the District,
and these orders, which may well serve as a model to other communities
desiring to undertake similar measures, may be briefly condensed as
follows:</p>

<p>All stalls in which animals are kept shall have the surface of the
ground covered with a water-tight floor. Every person occupying a
building where domestic animals are kept shall maintain, in connection
therewith, a bin or pit for the reception of manure, and, pending
the removal from the premises of the manure from the animal or animals,
shall place such manure in said bin or pit. This bin shall be so
constructed as to exclude rain water, and shall in all other respects be
water tight except as it may be connected with the public sewer. It
shall be provided with a suitable cover and constructed so as to prevent
the ingress and egress of flies. No person owning a stable shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
keep any manure or permit any manure to be kept in or upon any portion
of the premises other than the bin or pit described, nor shall he
allow any such bin or pit to be overfilled or needlessly uncovered.
Horse manure may be kept tightly rammed into well-covered barrels
for the purpose of removal in such barrels. Every person keeping
manure in any of the more densely populated parts of the District
shall cause all such manure to be removed from the premises at least
twice every week between June 1 and October 31, and at least once
every week between November 1 and May 31 of the following year.
No person shall remove or transport any manure over any public
highway in any of the more densely populated parts of the District
except in a tight vehicle which, if not inclosed, must be effectually
covered with canvas, so as to prevent the manure from being dropped.
No person shall deposit manure removed from the bins or pits within
any of the more densely populated parts of the District without a permit
from the health officer. Any person violating any of the provisions
shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not
more than $40 for each offense.</p>

<p>As with all such measures, the test comes with the enforcement, and
these regulations have not been well enforced, owing to the extremely
small corps of inspectors allowed to the Health Department, and to
other more pressing work. They can be made effective, however,
and it is earnestly hoped that not only Washington but other communities
as well will very soon be brought to a realization of the ease
of house-fly eradication and its very great desirability.</p>

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
